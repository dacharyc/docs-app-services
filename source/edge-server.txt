.. introduction::

   You have a warehouse, retail store, air-gapped laboratory, or another 
   premises where devices should be able to seamlessly sync their data.
   Those locations may or may not be online at any given time. Lack of a 
   network connection shouldn't prevent the devices from sharing data
   with each other.

   Edge Server runs on-premises and handles sync between local devices,
   and bi-directional sync between the Edge Server and Atlas.

   Edge Server is currently in private preview. If you are interested in 
   previewing the Atlas Device Sync Edge Server, complete this form.

      Edge server is a local instance of MongoDB paired with a sync server 
      that runs on-premises. It brings real-time sync, disconnection 
      tolerance, and conflict resolution to the location's devices.

      Delta sync ensures that only fields with changes in a document are 
      sent to Atlas. Mission-critical data is transferred efficiently while 
      minimizing network congestion.

      Edge clients can sync and access essential data independently, even 
      when disconnected from the central database. Applications and devices 
      in a connected infrastructure continue to function seamlessly, 
      even with intermittent connectivity.

.. kicker:: How it Works

Edge Server Setup
-----------------

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Create a Device Sync-Enabled App

      Create an :ref:`App Services App <create-app>` with 
      :ref:`Device Sync enabled <enable-sync>`.

      To get started quickly, create a template app.

      Once your App is created, coordinate with your Product or Account 
      Representative to enable Edge Server.

      .. button:: Start Building with a Template App
         :uri: https://www.mongodb.com/realm/register?tck=docs_CTA_app_services

   .. step:: Configure the Edge Server Host

      Configure hardware on-site or a cloud server to host your Edge Server.
      Refer to the documentation for required network access, hardware 
      requirements, and supported operating systems.

   .. step:: Install and Configure the Edge Server

      Install the Edge Server on your hardware, complete a basic 
      ``config.json`` with your configuration details, and install required
      dependencies.

   .. step:: Configure an Authentication Provider

      Enable an authentication provider to secure client connections to
      the Edge Server.

      Edge Server supports these authentication providers:

      - :ref:`Anonymous Authentication <anonymous-authentication>`
      - :ref:`Email/Password Authentication <email-password-authentication>`
      - :ref:`Custom JWT Authentication <custom-jwt-authentication>`
      - :ref:`API Key Authentication <api-key-authentication>`

   .. step:: Start the Edge Server

      With everything configured, a simple command starts the Edge Server.

      .. code:: console

         make up

   .. step:: Connect to the Edge Server from a Client

      Configure your client to connect to the Edge Server instead of directly
      to your Atlas App. Local clients can sync data through the Edge Server
      even without network connectivity. When the Edge Server connects
      with Atlas, it syncs data from the local clients.
