MongoDB collects telemetry data from Edge Server instances. In some cases, 
connected clients independently collect telemetry data. 

This data is used for diagnostic, troubleshooting, and feature development 
purposes.

Edge Server Data Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The telemetry that an Edge Server instance reports includes:

- Information about the hardware
- Information about data transfer

Hardware Telemetry
``````````````````

Edge Server instances report the following information about the hardware 
running the Edge Server code:

- CPU use as a percentage
- Memory use as a percentage

Data Transfer Telemetry
```````````````````````

Edge Server instances report the following information about data transfer:

- Regular pings with a health status
- Number of sync sessions

Connected Client Data Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Edge Server instances report some information about connected clients.

MongoDB Wire Protocol Connections
`````````````````````````````````

Edge Server instances report the following information about MongoDB Drivers
and Tools that connect using the Wire Protocol:

- Number of sessions
- Compute time

Additionally, Drivers and tools may have their own telemetry.

Atlas Device SDK Connections
````````````````````````````

Edge Server instances report the following information about MongoDB Drivers
and Tools that connect using Atlas Device SDK:

- Number of connections
- Number of sessions

Atlas Device SDK collects anonymized telemetry under some circumstances.
For information about this telemetry, including how to disable it, refer
to the telemetry page for the SDK you use:

- :ref:`telemetry-cpp`
- :ref:`telemetry-dotnet`
- :ref:`telemetry-flutter`
- :ref:`telemetry-java`
- :ref:`telemetry-kotlin`
- :ref:`telemetry-node`
- :ref:`telemetry-react-native`
- :ref:`telemetry-swift`
- :ref:`telemetry-web`

An Edge Server instance does not track:

- IP addresses of connected clients
